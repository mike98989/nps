            <h3><strong>Inmates's Training and Productivity</strong></h3>
              <p>
                The  Inmates&rsquo; Training and Productivity (ITP) Directorate is also charged with the  responsibility of training inmates specifically in Prison Farms and Industries  for the purpose of not only imparting self-sustaining skills on them but also  in the process inculcating in them the positive orientation of finding dignity  in labour.<br>
                To  that extent, this Directorate manages the Prisons workshops earlier  mentioned.  There are also cottage  industries which train inmates in mid-range industrial production.  Some of these are furniture making, soap  making, toilet roll, manufacturing aluminum pots and metal works fabrications  etc.  These are all geared towards giving  our inmates practical skills that can help them live self-sustaining lives on  discharge.<br>
                The  other branch of this Directorate is the Agric section.  This is the section that manages the Prison  Farm Centres as well as the subsidiary farms and the market gardens.  The fundamental objective of the section is  the training of inmates in farming methods, in Animal husbandry and other  agricultural extension techniques.  The  purpose being to teach agricultural skills to inmates to enable them stand on  their own in these vocations on discharge.   Although the primary objective of the farms is essentially to train  inmates as stated above, the Mechanized farm is capital intensive so much so  that these farms are not only expected to generate commensurate revenue, they  are expected to impact positively on the food situation in the country, by  making cheap food available to the national economy.</p>
