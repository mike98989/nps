                The  Works and Logistics Directorate is the infrastructural mainframe  Directorate.  This is the Directorate  that caters for both mobile and immobile prison infrastructure.  It is divided into two broad sections,  namely, the Works and the Logistic sections.  <br>
                The  Works section has the responsibility of articulating, planning, implementing,  supervising/monitoring the construction of prison projects.  As prison is mainly about buildings and  walls, this section undertakes the construction/supervision of prison  cells/walls, barracks and office as well as hospital buildings  construction.  <br>
                The  Maintenance Unit of the section undertakes the maintenance of prison  infrastructures like offices, prison walls, cells, barracks etc.   <br>
                The  other section in the Directorate is the Logistics section.  This is the section that is charged with the  responsibility of maintaining the fleet of prison vehicles and plants.  This means that this section is responsible  for the maintenance of all departmental vehicles including farm machineries,  plants and escort duty fleet.   </p>
