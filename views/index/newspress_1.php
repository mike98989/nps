              <p>The  Controller General of Prisons, Ahmed Ja&rsquo;afaru, has commissioned 133 Assistant  Superintendents of Prisons, who just concluded their six months training at the  Prisons Staff College, Barnawa, Kaduna. <br>
               The  Course tagged 24th ASP Basic Course International had in  participation 123 Nigerians and 10 allied officers from South Sudan. <br>
               The  Controller General of Prisons who was represented at the Passing out ceremony  by the Deputy Controller General of Prisons, in charge of Finance and Budget  Directorate, while congratulating the graduating officers admonished them to be  good ambassadors of the college and by extension the Service. <br>
               Ja&rsquo;afaru  explained that the Prisons Staff College, which was established in 1986, was  set up for the training of senior Prisons officers who hitherto were sent  overseas for courses. He further explained that the Basic Course was primarily  designed for Assistant Superintendents of Prisons and other senior officers to  equip them with the basic knowhow of Prisons management. He expressed optimism  that the graduands have been adequately exposed to the basic knowledge of the  Corrections profession. <br>
               He  encouraged the graduating officers to execute their duties henceforth with a  new zeal pointing out that the Corrections profession demands absolute  commitment, foresight, loyalty, perseverance and patriotism to achieve its  Mandate. <br>
               Expressing  his discontent at the recent spate of escapes and jailbreaks he admonished the  cadets to show commitment to the actualisation of the mandate of the Service,  chief of which is the safe custody of all legally committed to the prisons, the  CGP warned that none who is found wanting due to negligence of duty would be  spared.  <br>
               Ja&rsquo;afaru  acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the graduands but assured them  of the commitment of the Management of the Prisons to ensure that structures  and processes are put in place to enhance effective performance of duties by  all Prison officers. <br>
               To the  foreign participants from South Sudan the CGP urged them to be good ambassadors  of the college in particular and the country in general as they put to use the  knowledge acquired to create positive changes that would enhance the justice  system in their country.<br>
               Highlight  of the ceremony was a beautiful parade display by the graduating students which  was indeed a delight to watch.<br>
               10  Students – 1 South Sudanese and 9 Nigerian – who excelled in various fields  were publicly acknowledged and rewarded. The fields include, academics, fields  activities, leadership, discipline and marksmanship.   <br>
