              <p>The  Controller-General of Prisons, Ja&rsquo;afaru Ahmed has re-opened 8 out of the 9  Satellite Prisons in Bauchi State, North East of Nigeria that were closed down  in 2012 in the wake of Boko Haram insurgency after securing the approval of the  Honourable Minister of Interior, Lt. General Abdulrahman Dambazau (Rtd), CFR,  PhD. The satellite prisons are Alkaleri, Burra, Darazo, Katagum, Shira, Tafa  Balewa and Toro. They were re-opened on Monday 15th August, 2016.  Gamawa, the 8th satellite prison will however remain closed till it&rsquo;s conducive  enough to receive prisoners under safe and humane conditions.Â  <br>
Prisoners  are drawn from main prisons that had borne the burden of accommodating inmates  in the state while the insurgency lasted. The re-opening of the satellite  prisons will significantly reduced congestion and the attendant management  difficulties in the main prisons across the state. <br>
Recall that  due to the Boko Haram insurgency that affected most government security  establishments a couple of years back, some prisons in the North Eastern zone  were closed down.</p>
